# The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors Game


Project I did for the [Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors) from the The Odin Project Foundations course. This project was very important to solidify knowledge about DOM manipulation and it was amazingly fun to do it. Put it a little of personal touch and turn it into a Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game. Have fun playing it!
